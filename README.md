I I have downloaded the CSV raw data from Kaggle, each dataset contains 11 columns, and I am going to use the following 
analysis steps:
1.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values.
2.Descriptive Statistics: Provide summary statistics for numerical columns.
3.Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiments based on ratings and review text.
4.Recommendation Analysis: Investigate the correlation between ratings, recommendations, and feedback.
5.Category Analysis: Examine reviews and ratings across different divisions, departments, and classes
6. Data visualization:  representing information through visual elements 

- Data Cleaning :Fill missing values in 'Title' and 'Review Text' with empty strings 
                  :Fill missing values in 'Division Name', 'Department Name', and 'Class Name' with 'Unknown'
                  :Drop the Unnamed column
                  :Verify that there are no more missing values
After go the next step : Descriptive Statistics, Sentiment Analysis, Recommendation Analysis, Category Analysis, Data visualization,
Then go the next step.

-Data visualization : import seaborn as sns, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, These packages are used for the visualisation of data.
                    : Use matplotlib and seaborn to create the histogram, Scatter, Boxplot, Bar Graph and pie Chart
